## How to Use

### Scan Modes
| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Folder** | Scan a specific folder path |
| **Full System** | Scan entire filesystem (slower) |
| **Find File Dups** | Find all duplicates of ONE specific file |

### Workflow
1. Enter a folder path (e.g. `/home/user` or `C:\Users\Name`)
2. Press **Scan** — results appear in real-time
3. Use **Group by** to switch between Folder / Category / Flat view
4. Click **👁️ Preview** to open side-by-side comparison
5. **✓ Checkbox** = mark as reviewed
6. **🗑️ Delete** = actually delete the file from disk
7. Download **Report** as .txt anytime

## Data Storage
All data is stored in Windows AppData (production-style):
- **Windows AppData Path**: `%LOCALAPPDATA%/DupScan/`
- **History**: `%LOCALAPPDATA%/DupScan/history.json`
- **Reports**: `%LOCALAPPDATA%/DupScan/reports/`
- **No files** are stored in the project directory
- **Auto-cleanup**: Keeps only the last 50 scan reports
```

---

## Tips
- The **first file** in each group is the **KEEP** (oldest/original)
- Use **Find File Dups** mode to locate all copies of one specific file
- History is saved automatically when a scan completes
- Reports are automatically saved to your AppData folder
- Last 50 reports are kept; older ones are auto-deleted
